# socializer 

A desktop application for handling vk.com in an easy way.

This source code is completely experimental. The current functionality in this application is not very useful. If you are not a developer, or you don't know how to deal with Python code and some network Rest API'S, probably you should not clone this repository and run the application. If you decide to do so, take into account that this doesn't work as an application yet.

I have started this effort as an open source  project on Feb 13, 2016. Pull requests and bug reports are welcome. Socializer is not a definitive name for this project, it could be changed in future.

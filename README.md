# socializer 

> Note: this project has two different main repositories. [Here is the official repository, hosted in my Gitlab Instance,](https://code.manuelcortez.net/manuelcortez/socializer) [Here is a mirror repository hosted in GitHub.](https://github.com/manuelcortez/socializer) Github repository will accept pull requests and issues reported by github users, while Gitlab's repository will provide the wiki, documentation, and support for user reported issues.

A desktop application for handling [vk.com](http://vk.com) in an easy way.

## download the current  build

Socializer's functionality is far to be perfect, in fact there are lots of methods of the VK API that this application doesn't support  right now, but if you are curious enough, and you want to help by giving me your impressions and making  tests for fixing  bugs, you can download the last source code, compiled as an application. This is the   snapshot build of socializer. This version is only for testing purposes, never think that it can be used for everyday use. This version does not include any documentation, Only the changelog, because it's build with an authomatic process.

Before downloading, take in to account the following: This source code is completely experimental. The current functionality in this application is not very useful. If you decide to use nightly build versions, take into account that this doesn't work as an application for everyday use yet.

Version: 2016.07.9  
Build date: Jul 9 2016

## Documentation

I am trying to write an updated manual for socializer. It can be found in the documentation folder once the program zip file is uncompressed, or in the manual.md file (in markdown). The idea of this manual is to be updated as socializer receives new features  or improvements.

A copy of the English version of the manual can be read here: [Manual in the socializer's wiki](https://code.manuelcortez.net/manuelcortez/socializer/wikis/manual)

## Contributing

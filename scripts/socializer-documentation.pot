"* Better performance on Socializer should be noticed for users with many "

"* In all audio buffers, there is a new item in the context menu that "
"allows downloading of the audio directly from the buffer. If there are "
"multiple audios selected, socializer will ask for a folder where  all "
"audios should be placed. When downloading multiple audios, socializer "
"will name those automatically by following the template \"song title - "
"artist\"."

"* In all audio buffers, there are two new menu items for selecting and "

"* Fixed an error that was making socializer unable to render correctly "
"certain Links containing uppercase letters (such as yandex.disk shared "

" \"online now\" notification could break the Socializer interface, making"

#: changelog.py:34
msgid ""
"* Fixed a small inconsistency when marking a conversation as read. "
"Before, if two messages were sent by the recipient, only the last message"

"time. Now that issue should be handled properly."
msgstr ""

#: changelog.py:38
msgid ""
"* Socializer will not be marked as Virus by most antivirus softwares due "
"to a new build tool which is cleaner and less prone to be flagged by "
"antivirus."
msgstr ""

#: changelog.py:39
msgid ""
"* Socializer is distributed with the Microsoft C++ redistributable "
"package, so everyone will be able to use the software without needing to "
"install any extra package."
msgstr ""

#: changelog.py:40
msgid ""
"* Replaced the underlying library  we were using for spelling correction "
"as is no longer in development. Instead, we started to use a new approach"
" in socializer, which, in theory, should allow us to switch language for "
"spelling correction and other benefits a bit later. For now, available "
"languages are Russian, Ukranian, English, Polish and Spanish, but more "
"languages can be added by request."
msgstr ""

#: changelog.py:41

msgstr ""

#: changelog.py:50
msgid ""
"* Socializer is now more tolerant to internet issues. When attempting to "
"create a wall post, comment, topic or send a chat message, if the data is"

"again, giving you the opportunity to edit or copy the text of the post in"
" case you want to save it for later."
msgstr ""

#: changelog.py:51
msgid ""
"* Switching accounts is now supported in socializer. In the application "
"menu, there is an option called \"manage accounts\" which allows you to "

" the application. In case of having multiple accounts, every time "
"Socializer starts, you will see a dialog from where is possible to choose"
" the account for logging in."
msgstr ""

#: changelog.py:52
msgid ""
"* when selecting multiple audio files in audio buffers, multiple actions "
"can be performed in all items, these actions are present in the "
"contextual menu of the buffer (namely play, add/remove from the library "
"and move to a different playlist). This means you can select all the "
"audios you want and Socializer will perform the selected options in all "
"items, making it a bit easier to operate with multiple songs."

#: changelog.py:56
msgid ""
"* Added management of the Blacklist on VK. Users can be blocked from "

"image but cancel the dialog for attaching it."
msgstr ""

#: changelog.py:64
msgid ""
"* Fixed an error that was making Socializer to fail when loading the "
"newsfeed buffer, thus not loading any other buffers. This error was "
"caused due to VK sending a new object type representing push "
"subscriptions. The item is ignored by Socializer so it will not break the"
" newsfeed buffer anymore."
msgstr ""

#: changelog.py:65
msgid ""
"* Fixed an error that was making the status bar to not fit the full size "

"post in the group's behalf or as yourself."
msgstr ""

#: changelog.py:82
msgid ""
"* In all audio buffers, it is possible to select individual tracks to be "
"played together. In order to do so, you need to press space to start the "
"selection of items. When selected, the item will emit a sound to indicate"
" the change. Press space in all items you want to select/unselect. When "
"you're focusing an already selected item it will play a sound to indicate"
" that it is already selected. Once you're done with your selection, "
"pressing enter in the list of tracks will start the playback of the list "
"of items you have selected. This is a very experimental feature. More "

"sent as attachments in messages."
msgstr ""

#: changelog.py:84
msgid ""
"* In people buffers, it is possible to create a new timeline by using the"

"bar, where you have to type the username or find it in a list."
msgstr ""

#: changelog.py:88
msgid ""
"* Fixed an error with two factor authentication in the recent socializer "
"version. Now it works reliably again."
msgstr ""

#: changelog.py:89
msgid ""
"* Fixed an error when trying to attach a photo to a wall post. The error "
"was fixed in the [vk_api](https://github.com/python273/vk_api) module and"
" the fix was sent to the developer of the library, so he will be able to "
"merge it in the next version. In the meantime, socializer already "

msgstr ""

#: changelog.py:99
msgid ""
"    - When playing a voice message, if a song is playing already "

msgid ""
"* Removed some old keystrokes in socializer buffers due to better "

msgid "﻿# Socializer's manual "
msgstr ""

msgid "## Introduction"
msgstr ""

msgid "Socializer is an application to use [VK.com](https://vk.com) in an easy and accessible way with minimal CPU resource usage. Socializer will allow you to interact with the VK social network by giving you access to the most relevant features such as:"
msgstr ""

msgid "* Supports two factor authentication (2FA)."
msgstr ""

msgid "* Basic post creation in your wall (including photos)."
msgstr ""

msgid "* audio support."
msgstr ""

msgid "* Post comments."
msgstr ""

msgid "* like, unlike and repost other's posts."
msgstr ""

msgid "* Open other's timelines so you could track their friends, posts or audio files."
msgstr ""

msgid "* Basic chat features."
msgstr ""

msgid "## Usage"
msgstr ""

msgid "In order to use socializer, you must have an account in the [VK](https://vk.com) website. The process for registering an account is very accessible and is not covered in this manual. In the documentation, it is assumed you have a registered account on VK and you are able to sign in in the website by providing your phone number or email address, and a password. You will require this data for signing in the application later."
msgstr ""

msgid "## authorising the application"
msgstr ""

msgid "First of all, it's necessary to authorise the application so it can access your VK account and act on your behalf. The authorisation process is quite simple, and will be required only once. In order to start the authorisation process, you just need to run the executable file called \"socializer.exe\" (on some computers it will appear only as socializer, depending if windows explorer is set to display file extensions or not). You may like to place a Windows shortcut in your desktop for an easier access to the application."
msgstr ""

msgid "If this is the first time you have launched socializer, you will see a message asking you whether socializer should connect through a proxy server, already configured in the application, or use the system network settings. This allows people from countries where VK is blocked to use the social network without having to look for a proxy server themselves. It is highly adviced to use the proxy server only if you are in need of it."
msgstr ""

msgid "After the proxy message, you will see a new message dialog asking you to proceed with the account authorisation process. It consists in providing the authentication data you normally use to sign in VK. It is very important to know that this data will be stored in a folder called config, located in the same folder where the socializer files are. Your config folder is a very important storage for your authentication data, so you must be sure you never will share it with anyone, mostly because your data is stored as plain text (this will be fixed in a future release and your data will be properly encrypted). Socializer will need your authentication data for acting in your behalf and offering you a better experience that what it could do with a simple access token. You must provide your phone number or email address in the first text box, and your password in the second. When pressing OK, your data will be saved and the application will start to retrieve all the required information for showing your buffers. If you have two factor authentication configured in your account, you will see an additional dialog where you have to type the code provided by VK via SMS."
msgstr ""

msgid "Once started, the application will start loading your data (posts, audio files, conversations, friends). When done, it will show you a notification indicating that the program is ready."
msgstr ""

msgid "## General concepts"
msgstr ""

msgid "Before starting to describe Socializer's usage, we'll explain some concepts that will be used extensively throughout this manual."
msgstr ""

msgid "### Buffer"
msgstr ""

msgid "A buffer is a list of items that will manage the data which arrives from VK, after being processed by the application. When you configure your account on Socializer and start it, many buffers are created. Each of them may contain some of the items which this program works with: Newsfeed posts, wall posts, audio and video files, friendship requests and conversations. According to the buffer you are focusing, you will be able to do different actions with these items."
msgstr ""

msgid "All buffers will be updated in one of the following ways:"
msgstr ""

msgid "* Periodically: Most buffers containing posts, audio or video files and people, will be updated periodically to reflect the new additions to them. Updates will be every 2 minutes for every buffer, so if you posted something and did not see the post in the buffer, you may need to wait a moment. There is an option, located in the buffer menu on the menu bar, which allows you to trigger a manual update in the current buffer."
msgstr ""

msgid "* Real time: Conversation buffers will be updated every time someone sends a message to you. When an user sends you a message, if there is not a conversation buffer created to receive the message, a new conversation buffer will be opened automatically and the message will be placed on it. If you already have an opened conversation for the user sending the message, the message will be placed at the end of the buffer. A different sound will indicate whether a new conversation has been opened or an existing buffer gets updated."
msgstr ""

msgid "### item"
msgstr ""

msgid "An item is an element representing some data provided by VK. Items are separated in buffers which stores items of the same type: Audio buffers will contain only audio files, wall buffers will be full of wall posts. The only exception to this rule is the newsfeed buffer, which can contain different kind of items. Actions are available in a per-item basis, allowing certain items to be treated differently than others and showing different dialogs, depending in the kind of data VK sends for them. All items show a menu with their available actions by focusing them in the list and pressing the menu key or a right mouse click."
msgstr ""

msgid "The following is a brief description of the kind of items socializer can work with, and what actions are available for those."
msgstr ""

msgid "* Newsfeed post: It represents a post displayed in your \"home\" page on VK. It may contain a variety of information based in what you or your friends do. A newsfeed item may contain information about new audios added to your friend's library, new people added to friends, wall posts, reposts and new photos added. Depending on the kind of data VK has supplied, the item can open a dialog showing information about the post, a list displaying the people added to friends, or a dialog displaying information for every audio added to library. If a wall post contains a long message, only the first 140 characters will be displayed. You can open the post to read the full message in the dialog. Available options for this item are different depending in the information the item contains. You can open or view the profile of the user that generated the item, like, dislike or add a comment to a post."
msgstr ""

msgid "* Wall post: Represent a post in an user's wall. This post will be similar to wall posts displayed in the newsfeed. If a wall post contains a long message, only the first 140 characters will be displayed. You can open the post to read the full message in the dialog. When opened (by pressing enter or the open option in the associated menu), it will show a dialogue where you can read the message, see how many times the post has been viewed by other users, interact with attachment files (by searching the list and pressing enter in the focused attachment to open it), see the photos included in the post, read information related to likes and times the post has been shared, read and reply to comments. Additionally, you can share the post, indicate you like it, or add a comment. You can cycle through every item in the dialog by pressing tab."
msgstr ""

msgid "* Audio: It represent an audio uploaded to the VK'S platform. Actions available for this item are opening the audio in a dialog, add or remove it from your library, move the audio to a playlist, and play it. When opened, it will be displayed in a dialog allowing you to read the title of the song, artist name, duration and a few buttons: play, add or remove from your library and download. You can control playback of audio items from the buffer by using the player menu on the menu bar or the corresponding keyboard shortcuts."
msgstr ""

msgid "* Video: It represent a video uploaded to the VK'S platform. Actions available for this item are opening the video in your default web browser and move it to a video album. When opened, it will open a web browser and play the video automatically due to VK limitations in access to video files."
msgstr ""

msgid "* person: It contains information about a VK user, this item is present in all buffers under the \"people\" category. Actions available for this item are view user profile, send message and create a timeline, which is a special buffer to track all posts, friends or audios owned by the user. When opened, it will display the profile of this user in a dialog and will provide actions to send a message to the user, or view other sections of her/his profile."
msgstr ""

msgid "* Message: A message appears only in conversation buffers and represents a chat message. It may include a list of attached files that will be displayed in a separated list. You can tab to that list (from the history) and press enter in the attached file you want to open. Chat items are marked as read automatically as soon as they are focused."
